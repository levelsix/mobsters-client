//1. send to everyone (global)
//2. send to all current clan members
//3. private (one to -one)
//4. groups

//ABSTRACTION
//1. create chat rooms, received authToken on creation
    //1.1 rooms have tags enum, global, clan, private, group
//2. whoever created the chat room can modify it (either server or player), aka owner of authToken
//3. users are identified by UUID
//4. messages are routed based on roomId (roomIds are UUID)
//5. translation...
//6. user can specify language preference per chat room
//7. translation in global chat and private, NOT in groups or clan
//8. try to translate with timeout of 5 sec, otherwise give up and just store original
//9. the list of languages that we're translation to is determined by the set of all languages in the room minus the sender's lang
//10. events for typing and read receipts
//11. login/logout
//12. enums for game events
//13. at login we have to send global and clan (you can "query" rooms by tags and have limit) (last message from each room)
//14. api event to retrieve messages for roomId
//15. uuid for every client event
//16. both client and server implement retries for all events
